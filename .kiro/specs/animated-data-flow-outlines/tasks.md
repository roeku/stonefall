# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create tower edge mapping system

  - Build a coordinate mapping system that extracts precise edge positions from all tower blocks
  - Create data structures to store block corners, edges, and connection points
  - Implement functions to calculate exact edge coordinates using the same convertPosition logic as GameBlock
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Implement continuous path generation

  - Create algorithms to generate continuous paths that flow along block edges
  - Build connection logic that links edges between adjacent blocks
  - Implement path routing that creates realistic data flow routes through the tower
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Create individual flowing energy segments

  - Implement energy segments using TubeGeometry that move along the mapped paths
  - Create animation system using useFrame for smooth 60fps segment movement
  - Add timing offsets so multiple segments flow along the same path without overlapping
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.5, 3.1, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Implement proper visual styling

  - Use game's orange/tron color scheme (#ff4500) with purple accents (#8800ff)
  - Add gold/yellow colors for perfect placement enhancement
  - Ensure segments are clearly visible against block surfaces with proper opacity
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.3_

- [x] 5. Add block connection system

  - Create vertical connection paths between stacked blocks
  - Implement smooth transitions where energy flows from one block to the next
  - Add logic to show increased activity on higher blocks
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4, 3.2_

- [x] 6. Optimize performance and rendering
  - Implement efficient geometry reuse for similar path segments
  - Add level-of-detail system to reduce complexity for distant blocks
  - Ensure stable 60fps performance with multiple flowing segments
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4_
