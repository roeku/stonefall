# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates animated energy flow lines that follow the edges of the tower blocks, similar to data flowing through a circuit board or cyberpunk network. The goal is to create individual flowing lines that move along the actual block edges and connect between blocks, creating a unified tower network visualization that matches the game's tron-style aesthetic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see individual flowing energy lines along the tower edges that simulate data packets moving through the structure, so that the tower feels like a connected network system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN blocks are placed THEN the system SHALL map the exact edge coordinates of each block
2. WHEN the game is running THEN individual energy lines SHALL flow continuously along these mapped edges
3. WHEN multiple blocks are stacked THEN the flowing lines SHALL connect between blocks to show data transfer
4. WHEN lines animate THEN they SHALL move smoothly along the actual block edges, not float in space
5. WHEN the animation runs THEN individual line segments SHALL be visible moving along the paths

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the energy flow lines to use the game's visual theme and respond to gameplay events, so that they integrate seamlessly with the existing aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN lines are rendered THEN they SHALL use the game's orange/tron color scheme with purple accents
2. WHEN a perfect placement occurs THEN the flow lines SHALL briefly intensify with gold/yellow colors
3. WHEN blocks are connected THEN the flow lines SHALL create continuous paths between block edges
4. WHEN the tower grows THEN more flow lines SHALL appear on the higher blocks to show increased activity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the energy flow lines to create realistic data packet movement, so that it looks like actual information flowing through the tower network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN lines flow THEN they SHALL move as individual segments along continuous paths
2. WHEN segments reach block boundaries THEN they SHALL smoothly transition between connected blocks
3. WHEN multiple paths exist THEN different lines SHALL follow different routes through the tower
4. WHEN lines animate THEN they SHALL have varying speeds and timing to create organic movement

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the energy flow animation to be performant and visually clear, so that it enhances gameplay without distraction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the animation runs THEN it SHALL maintain 60fps performance
2. WHEN lines are rendered THEN they SHALL be clearly visible against the block surfaces
3. WHEN multiple lines flow THEN they SHALL not overlap or interfere with each other visually
4. WHEN the tower grows tall THEN the system SHALL efficiently handle increasing numbers of flow paths
