# Tron: Legacy Game End Modal - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a sophisticated game-end modal that appears when a player completes a tower defense game session. The modal serves as both a celebration of achievement and a gateway to further engagement, displaying the player's performance statistics and providing clear next actions. The design must strictly adhere to the established Tron: Legacy aesthetic, building upon the successful data-ribbon design patterns already implemented in the game.

The modal appears as an overlay on top of the UnifiedTowerSystem while towers are loading, creating a seamless transition from gameplay to post-game experience. It combines functional information display with the cinematic, high-tech visual language of Tron: Legacy.
